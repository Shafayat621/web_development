      During my studies at AIUB, I have been involved in several academic and
      personal projects that strengthened my technical and problem-solving
      abilities. One of the key areas I have worked on is digital logic design,
      where I developed practical circuits using flip-flops, counters, and logic
      gates. I have also completed projects related to software engineering,
      such as designing systems using UML diagrams and applying agile
      methodologies. These projects have helped me understand both the
      theoretical and practical aspects of computer science. Through teamwork,
      planning, and hands-on implementation, I have improved my ability to
      manage deadlines, collaborate with peers, and deliver functional
      solutions.
