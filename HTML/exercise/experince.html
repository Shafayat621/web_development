    <p>
      I have gained valuable experience in both academic and practical fields.
      As a Computer Science and Engineering student at AIUB, I have worked on
      various projects that enhanced my skills in programming, digital logic
      design, and software engineering. Beyond academics, I have developed
      strong communication and motivational skills through my role as a
      motivational speaker, where Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to influence and
      inspire others. I also have hands-on experience with operating motorized
      vehicles, including excellent riding and driving skills, which I regularly
      apply during city commutes and monthly tours. In addition, I am highly
      skilled in mobile gaming and have developed a strong sense of patience,
      strategy, and quick decision-making through this interest.
