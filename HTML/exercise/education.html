      I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and
      Engineering (CSE) at the American International University-Bangladesh
      (AIUB). Prior to this, I completed my Secondary School Certificate (SSC)
      from Monipur High School and College, and went on to complete my Higher
      Secondary Certificate (HSC) from Milestone College. Throughout my academic
      journey, I have developed a strong foundation in technology and
      problem-solving, which has fueled my passion for computer science and
      driven me to continuously learn and improve.
